# TerraForming-Inheritance
Used abstract classes and inheritance

This assignment utilized abstract classes and inheritance in order to design a planet with elements such as plants, water, minerals, and animals to create a positive or negative impact on the environment. The highest parent class was the terraobject class. The plant, water, mineral, and animal classes inherited from this class and each of these had their own subclasses. The TerraObject Factory generated our world and the impact score was cacculated there. The tester file allowed us to generate the specific objects with specified percentages and print them to the console.
